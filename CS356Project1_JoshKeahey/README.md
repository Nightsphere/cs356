# Project 1: Study of Cryptographic Techniques

This security program was created by Josh Keahey and does the following:

 - Two programs that implement the transposition cipher.
	1. The first program will be used to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
            * This encrypts the plaintext by using the double transposition
            method
	2. The seconds program will convert the ciphertext back into plaintext
            * This decrypts by doing the double transposition method backwards
