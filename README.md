CS356 - Systems Security

The following description comes from the CS356 website

Cyber-security is a hot topic – every day new data breaches, malware, or hacking exploits impact critical systems. As a result, there is huge demand for computer science graduates trained in systems and network security. In this course you will learn cyber-security concepts and technology and how to write self-defensive software to protect your organization and yourself. This course will cover:

* Computer security concepts
* Cryptographic tools
* User authentication & access control
* Database security
* Malicious software
* Denial of service attacks
* Intrusion detection and prevention systems
* Buffer overflow attacks
* Internet authentication
* Wireless security
* Internet security protocols
* Blockchain and Bitcoin

You will begin by learning basic cryptographic tools, then how hackers break into systems (“the dark side”), and finally defensive programming techniques (“defense against the dark arts”). Hands-on programming projects (ethical hacking, blockchain), case studies, videos, current event discussion (cyber crime/warfare/terrorism), and demos (rob a bank, hack a database) will help you solidify and confidently apply your skills.
